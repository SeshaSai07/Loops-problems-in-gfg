Question:

Given a number x, the task is to print the numbers from x to 0 in decreasing order in a single line.

Example:

Input: x = 3
Output: 3 2 1 0
Explanation: Numbers in decreasing order from 3 are 3 2 1 0.
Input: x = 5
Output: 5 4 3 2 1 0
Explanation: Numbers in decreasing order from 5 are 5 4 3 2 1 0.

Constraints:
0 ≤ x ≤ 5

Solution:

import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
    public static void solve() {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        // Your Code Here
       int x = sc.nextInt();
       while(x >= 0) 
       {
           System.out.print(x + " ");
           x--;
       }
    }
}
